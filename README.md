# Automated-SHM-Crack-Classification
Deep learning framework for binary crack classification in structural images using CNN and Transformer models. Experiments include learning rate sensitivity, low-resource training, and real-world field validation for automated Structural Health Monitoring applications.
This repository contains the code for my Final Year Project on Structural Health Monitoring (SHM) using machine learning for crack detection and classification in concrete structures. The codes are based on a single learning rate used during experiments; to see the effect of other learning rates, you can modify the --learning_rate parameter in the training scripts.
